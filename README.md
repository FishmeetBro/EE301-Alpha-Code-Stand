## Code Standards

To maintain consistency and readability in our code, we adhere to the following standards:

### Front-end Code Standards

- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Project naming: All lowercase, separated by hyphens.
  - Directory naming: All lowercase, separated by underscores.
  - File naming: All lowercase, separated by underscores.
  - Mixing Pinyin with English in code naming is strictly forbidden, as is using Chinese directly.

- **HTML Specifications**:
  - Recommend using the HTML5 document type declaration.
  - Indentation uses 2 spaces.
  - Add HTML comments after each block, list, and table element.

- **CSS Specifications**:
  - Class names use lowercase letters, separated by hyphens.
  - IDs use camelCase.
  - Variables, functions, mixins, and placeholders in SCSS are camel-cased.

- **JavaScript Standards**:
  - Variable, method, parameter names use camelCase.
  - Constant names are all uppercase, with words separated by underscores.

- **Vue Project Standards**:
  - Component names should be multiple words, in KebabCase format.
  - Component file names are in PascalCase format.

### Back-end Code Standards

- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Class names use UpperCamelCase style.
  - Method, parameter, member variable, and local variable names use lowerCamelCase style.
  - Constant names are all uppercase, with words separated by underscores.

- **Constant Definitions**:
  - Magic values (undefined constants) are not allowed to appear directly in the code.

- **Formatting Specifications**:
  - Indentation is 4 spaces, and tab characters are not allowed.
  - The number of characters in a single line should not exceed 120. Line wrapping should follow specific principles.

- **Control Statements**:
  - `if/else/for/while/do` statements must use braces, even if there is only one line of code.
